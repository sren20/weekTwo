    <p>I have a very strong work ethic.  At times this has both negatively and positively affect me. Some examples of both are the positive; where I am pushing myself extra hard at the gym, as well as the negative, where I am taking in way too much at work.  </p>

    <p>I also care deeply for others and will advocate for others.  I am learning to also take care of myself more.</p>  
    
    <p>I consider joining ReSkill as part of my self-care. I've taken many "tech" courses since 1998 and I always fall back to web development courses. I am finally taking the fear out and doing what I love. </p>
